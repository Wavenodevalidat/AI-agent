        "Overview MultiversX is a blockchain platform catering to the Metaverse, DeFi, and Web3-focused applications. It features scalable infrastructure, NFT support, and uses its EGLD token for key network functions. The platform focuses on security, decentralization, and environmentally sustainable operations. History Elrond is a new blockchain architecture, designed for high throughput and fast execution speed. To achieve this, Elrond introduces two key features: an Adaptive State Sharding mechanism, and a Secure Proof of Stake (PoS) algorithm, which aims to enable linear scalability. The team says its smart contract platform can process upwards of 15,000 transactions per second, with six-second latency and low transaction costs, yet aims to remain permissionless, borderless, and globally accessible. Elrond is built by a team of entrepreneurs, along with 13 engineers and researchers who have worked at various tech companies, such as Microsoft, Google, Intel, and NTT DATA, and have experience working with blockchain platforms. The team includes two PhDs in CS and AI, multiple math, CS, and AI Olympiad champions, and a former member of the NEM core team.",
